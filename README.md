Hello, welcome to my project Weather Check (v1.0)!

 1. There's a project focused on javascript studies. It consists on check every city's weather around the world by only searching their names.

 2. The API that I've used on this project is called OpenWeather and you can find on the OpenWeather website! There's a lot of data to explore, enjoy.

 3. You will check the weather in ÂºC and PT_BR language but you can change it easy on the API.

Hope you like =)
